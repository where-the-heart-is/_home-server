# @home Server

This repository holds the server files for the @home server.

A platform for independent landlords and tenants, simplifying the inherent complexities of the rental process.

The client is [here](https://github.com/where-the-heart-is/_home-client).

The database is [here](https://github.com/where-the-heart-is/_home-database).

@home is an app designed to help landlords manage rental properties as well as their
relationship with respective tenants. We envisioned the app as a responsive website for landlords
& tenants to have access whether they are on a computer or a mobile device. Landlords
who login can add/update/delete properties, tenants, & documents. They can also update
the status of any maintenance requests submitted by tenants. Tenants who login can
view their lease agreements, & submit maintenance requests that will go to the landlords
for approval & follow-up.

For creating the app we used HTML / CSS / JavaScript / jQuery / Handlebars / Bootstrap / Node-Express /
JSON Web Tokens / Heroku / Firebase / PostgreSQL / KNEX / Git & Github.

For workflow, we used pivotaltracking.com. We each forked a copy of the repository from the
Where the Heart Is organization & then feature branched. Each team member was a collaborator
that could stage, commit, push, & pull to the repository. But, any merge of pull
requests had to be done by another team member after reviewing changes. Code was
written via paired programming.
